- ⚡ Fun fact: The term “bug” in programming became famous in 1947 when engineers found a real moth stuck in a computer relay at Harvard. They taped it into the logbook and wrote “First actual case of bug being found.” 🦋
So every time you say “there’s a bug in my code”, you’re keeping a very literal tradition alive
